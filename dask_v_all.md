# Dask vs Ray vs Modin vs Vaex and RAPIDS

## Summary:
* Ray - scaling up pandas on a single machine
* Vaex - scaling up pandas on a single machine
* RAPIDS - scaling up pandas on a GPU-machine
* DASK - scaling out pandas/rapids on multiple machines. 


## Summary 2:
* Ray - a low-level framework for parallelizing Python code across processors or clusters.
* Vaex - a partial Pandas replacement that uses lazy evaluation and memory mapping to allow developers to work with large datasets on standard machines.
* RAPIDS - a collection of data-science libraries that run on GPUs and include cuDF, a partial replacement for Pandas
* DASK - a low-level scheduler and a high-level partial Pandas replacement, geared toward running code on compute clusters.
