# Dask vs Pyspark
### Source: 
https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/spark.html

Generally Dask is smaller and lighter weight than Spark. This means that it has fewer features and instead is intended to be used in conjunction with other libraries, particularly those in the numeric Python ecosystem.

Dask has an advantage for Python users because it is itself a Python library, so serialization and debugging when things go wrong happens more smoothly. Dask is simpler to use than spark. Dask is as flexible as Pandas with more power to compute with more cpu's parallely.
